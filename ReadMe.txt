my_faq.info.yml: Similar to the previous examples, 
updated with the autoload section specifying the src folder 
for autoloading.
src/Entity/Faq.php: Defines the Faq entity class extending 
ContentEntityBase. It includes code for defining base fields, 
pre-creation logic, entity type information, and a custom method 
to retrieve the FAQ category as a string.
src/Faq.module (optional): Similar to the previous examples, 
it defines hooks for creating the "faq" bundle and avoids 
defining field information again, relying on the Faq class definition.
